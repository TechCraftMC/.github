# TechCraft Network
> Welcome to the TechCraft Network GitHub profile. Here we publish code from various parts of the network for others to use, or contribute to. Please note that the majority of our repositories are private as they are core plugins we use and do not want to allow people to find exploits, or other defects which could be used with malicious intent.

## FAQs
- **Will you release code from core plugins?**
No. Core plugins will most likely never be made open source for security reasons.

- **Will you create a public API for TechCraft?**
We are currently working on creating a public API for TechCraft, however it is still in early development and therefore will not be available anytime soon.
